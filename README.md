# Vendering machine

This Vendering machine is programmed by python to handle the componenets.

There is a library "lib_sensor.py", which is open-source and is able to communicate with the
ordered components, even without having the parts actually.
There are two 7-segment displays and shift registers (SIPO) coming for the vending machine.
Segment displays will be connected to the SIPO which has serial communication capabilities.
